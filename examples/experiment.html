Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.</p>

(<span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">Mem.</em></span>, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the waiter, and he said it was called &#8220;paprika hendl,&#8221; and that, as it was a national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the Carpathians.

I find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states, Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina.</p>

I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting.

There was a dog howling all night under my window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then. I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was &#8220;mamaliga,&#8221; and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a very excellent dish, which they call &#8220;impletata.&#8221; (<span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">Mem.</em></span>, get recipe for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?</p>

Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other, and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are, however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural self-assertion.</p>

Being practically on the frontier&#8212;for the Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina&#8212;it has had a very stormy existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease.</p>

I was evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress&#8212;white undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and said, &#8220;The Herr Englishman?&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said, &#8220;Jonathan Harker.&#8221; She smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves, who had followed her to the door.

This could not be true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves, and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting.</p>

Oh! young Herr, must you go?&#8221; She was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business, she asked again:</p>

Do you not know that to-night, when the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?&#8221; She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the rosary round my neck, and said, &#8220;For your mother&#8217;s sake,&#8221; and went out of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still round my neck. Whether it is the old lady&#8217;s fear, or the many ghostly traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the coach!</p>

I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake, naturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they called &#8220;robber steak&#8221;&#8212;bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple style of the London cat&#8217;s meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.</p>

I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for there were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not cheering to me, for amongst them were &#8220;Ordog&#8221;&#8212;Satan, &#8220;pokol&#8221;&#8212;hell, &#8220;stregoica&#8221;&#8212;witch, &#8220;vrolok&#8221; and &#8220;vlkoslak&#8221;&#8212;both of which mean the same thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is either were-wolf or vampire.

With some difficulty I got a fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me, just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the box-seat&#8212;&#8220;gotza&#8221; they call them&#8212;cracked his big whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on our journey.</p>

Before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom&#8212;apple, plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the &#8220;Mittel Land&#8221; ran the road, losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.</p>

Right and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to be right before us:&#8212;</p>

    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pVdL0aSzb"><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">Abolition Soft 12pt</strong> As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses, and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and again we passed a leiter-wagon&#8212;the ordinary peasant&#8217;s cart&#8212;with its long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold, and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the hills were so steep that, despite our driver&#8217;s haste, the horses could only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home, but the driver would not hear of it. &#8220;No, no,&#8221; he said; &#8220;you must not walk here; the dogs are too fierce&#8221;; and then he added, with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantry&#8212;for he looked round to catch the approving smile of the rest&#8212;&#8220;and you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep.&#8221; The only stop he would make was a moment&#8217;s pause to light his lamps.</p>

He lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at Bistritz&#8212;the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye. Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle. The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I thought it was &#8220;An hour less than the time.&#8221; Then turning to me, he said in German worse than my own:&#8212;</p>

The Herr is not expected after all. He will now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better the next day.&#8221; Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then, amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing of themselves, a cal&#232;che, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:&#8212;</p>

You cannot deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.&#8221; As he spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my companions whispered to another the line from Burger&#8217;s &#8220;Lenore&#8221;:&#8212;</p>

The passenger turned his face away, at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. &#8220;Give me the Herr&#8217;s luggage,&#8221; said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the cal&#232;che. Then I descended from the side of the coach, as the cal&#232;che was close alongside, the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept on their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in excellent German:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pxsUYPHcu"><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">Abril Display 1</strong><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">0</strong><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">pt</strong> &#8220;The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the country) underneath the seat, if you should require it.&#8221; I did not take any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a little strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along, then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pb8laMg2H"><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">Abril Display </strong><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">9</strong><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">pt</strong> Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road&#8212;a long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper howling&#8212;that of wolves&#8212;which affected both the horses and myself in the same way&#8212;for I was minded to jump from the cal&#232;che and run, whilst they reared again and plunged madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.</p>

    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pp31uhGjx"><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">Abril Fat Face 12pt</strong> Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along. It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall, so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pXnzxdoxm"><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">Abril Fat Face 1</strong><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">1</strong><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">pt</strong> Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and, jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took his seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare. Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness around us I could watch the driver&#8217;s motions. He went rapidly to where the blue flame arose&#8212;it must have been very faint, for it did not seem to illumine the place around it at all&#8212;and gathering a few stones, formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it, for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.</p>

I could not see any cause for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues, with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled. For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand their true import.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pjiAauxML"><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">Abril Fat Face </strong><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">9</strong><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">pt</strong> All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see; but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the cal&#232;che, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.</p>

    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="paK6txwdD">When I could see again the driver was climbing into the cal&#232;che, and the wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky.</p>

And yet he must have been right, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dread being alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall not mind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that I have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness, or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has for me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings nothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep, and lying like Ophelia in the play, with &#8220;virgin crants and maiden strewments.&#8221; I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful!

The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours, but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met Mrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room.

She was sleeping soundly&#8212;so soundly that even my coming did not wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually a bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will be pleased with her, I am sure.&#8221;</p>

As she had spoken, I watched the Professor&#8217;s face, and saw it turn ashen grey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be; he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into her room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and forcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.</p>

He raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair, and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. &#8220;God! God! God!&#8221; he said. &#8220;What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that we are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poor mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such thing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we must not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we are beset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!&#8221; Suddenly he jumped to his feet. &#8220;Come,&#8221; he said, &#8220;come, we must see and act. Devils or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him all the same.&#8221; He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we went up to Lucy&#8217;s room.</p>

I am getting so strong again that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through some long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and feel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim half-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress more poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to life as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since, however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems to have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my wits&#8212;the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and commanded me to do I know not what&#8212;have all ceased. I go to bed now without any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grown quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from Haarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a day in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left alone. Thank God for mother&#8217;s sake, and dear Arthur&#8217;s, and for all our friends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, for last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I found him asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again, although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against the window-panes.</p>

Suddenly the door was burst open, and in rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I was thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord into the Superintendent&#8217;s study is almost unknown. Without an instant&#8217;s pause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and, as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was too quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely. Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was sprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a little pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist, keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment positively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. He was easily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quite placidly, simply repeating over and over again: &#8220;The blood is the life! The blood is the life!&#8221;</p>

I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in the next room&#8212;as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be&#8212;so that I might have called him. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to me the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep would try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to be alone, I opened my door and called out: &#8220;Is there anybody there?&#8221; There was no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again. Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog&#8217;s, but more fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but could see nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its wings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determined not to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in; seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. She said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p4lqAYrQW">&#8220;I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all right.&#8221;</p>

As she lay there in my arms, and I in hers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She was startled and a little frightened, and cried out: &#8220;What is that?&#8221; I tried to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I could hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there was the low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a crash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor. The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey wolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongst other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For a second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange and horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over&#8212;as if struck with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a moment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried to stir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother&#8217;s poor body, which seemed to grow cold already&#8212;for her dear heart had ceased to beat&#8212;weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.</p>

Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery, seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort me. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear their bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and they came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay over me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through the broken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I had got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them to go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew open for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went in a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear mother&#8217;s breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing had told me, but I didn&#8217;t like to remove them, and, besides, I would have some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised that the maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I went to the dining-room to look for them.</p>

They all four lay helpless on the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the table half full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious, and examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the sideboard, I found that the bottle which mother&#8217;s doctor uses for her&#8212;oh! did use&#8212;was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am back in the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead!

Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently and rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while, finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an hour&#8212;for it was now ten o&#8217;clock&#8212;and so rang and knocked again, but more impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing tight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too late? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of danger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses; and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry anywhere.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p333N4oIE"><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">Chaparral Pro Caption </strong><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">9</strong><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">pt</strong> I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and locked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse&#8217;s feet. They stopped at the gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue. When he saw me, he gasped out:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p3s4xyZcQ">Chaparral Pro Caption 8pt running element</p>

He paused and raised his hat as he said solemnly:&#8212;</p>

God&#8217;s will be done!&#8221; With his usual recuperative energy, he went on: &#8220;Come. If there be no way open to get in, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="puBa8tMho"><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">Chaparral Pro Display </strong><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">9</strong><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">pt</strong> We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen window. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and opened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There was no one in the kitchen or in the servants&#8217; rooms, which were close at hand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room, dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four servant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead, for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at each other, and as we moved away he said: &#8220;We can attend to them later.&#8221; Then we ascended to Lucy&#8217;s room. For an instant or two we paused at the door to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the room.</p>

On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her mother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror fixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more drawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her mother&#8217;s bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled. Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching poor Lucy&#8217;s breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:&#8212;</p>

The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I fancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure, but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her hands. He said to me:&#8212;</p>

You go wake those maids. Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them get heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as that beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anything more.&#8221;</p>

    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pfoNRrZ1S"><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">Charlemagne Std 12pt</strong> I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the women. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently affected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her sleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with them, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad as they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come with a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he must wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message, and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.</p>

I knew&#8212;as he knew&#8212;that it was a stand-up fight with death, and in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:&#8212;</p>

Lucy&#8217;s heart beat a trifle more audibly to the stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing&#8217;s face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in a hot sheet to dry her he said to me:&#8212;</p>

I noticed that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had ever seen her.</p>

In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he closing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly observes. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light enough for our purposes. Van Helsing&#8217;s sternness was somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:&#8212;</p>

I have not the heart to go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and it told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other occasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see and hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with good effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watched whilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good breakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where Lucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or two of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved. He handed me the paper saying only: &#8220;It dropped from Lucy&#8217;s breast when we carried her to the bath.&#8221;</p>

Was she, or is she, mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?&#8221; I was so bewildered that I did not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the paper, saying:&#8212;</p>

From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature. So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or rather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he said to me:&#8212;</p>

When I saw him four days ago down at his own place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so quick since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass all in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there wasn&#8217;t enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a bullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me without betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?&#8221; As he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspense regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His very heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him&#8212;and there was a royal lot of it, too&#8212;to keep him from breaking down. I paused before answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the Professor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed so much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered in the same phrase: &#8220;That&#8217;s so.&#8221;</p>

Van Helsing is simply frantic about it, and I am at my wits&#8217; end. I can&#8217;t even hazard a guess. There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall not occur again. Here we stay until all be well&#8212;or ill.&#8221; Quincey held out his hand. &#8220;Count me in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You and the Dutchman will tell me what to do, and I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>

The careful Professor had replaced it where it had come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye then lit on Van Helsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked around the room, and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put her poor thin hands before her pale face. We both understood what that meant&#8212;that she had realised to the full her mother&#8217;s death; so we tried what we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for a long time. We told her that either or both of us would now remain with her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fell into a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep she took the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped over and took the pieces from her. All the same, however, she went on with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her hands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering the fragments. Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as if in thought, but he said nothing.</p>

She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At times she slept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between sleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more haggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale gums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and sharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently changed the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying one. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him. Quincey went off to meet him at the station.</p>

When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking with emotion, and none of us could speak. In the hours that had passed, the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible were shortened. Arthur&#8217;s presence, however, seemed to act as a stimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she had done since we arrived.

With regard to patient, Renfield, there is more to say. He has had another outbreak, which might have had a dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended with any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier&#8217;s cart with two men made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours&#8212;the house to which, you will remember, the patient twice ran away. The men stopped at our gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. I was myself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and saw one of them come up to the house. As he passed the window of Renfield&#8217;s room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to. The man, who seemed a decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to &#8220;shut up for a foul-mouthed beggar,&#8221; whereon our man accused him of robbing him and wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to swing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice, so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his mind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying: &#8216;Lor&#8217; bless yer, sir, I wouldn&#8217;t mind what was said to me in a bloomin&#8217; madhouse. I pity ye and the guv&#8217;nor for havin&#8217; to live in the house with a wild beast like that.&#8217; Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him where the gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threats and curses and revilings from our man. I went down to see if I could make out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a well-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most genial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he blandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe that he was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry to say, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an hour I heard of him again. This time he had broken out through the window of his room, and was running down the avenue. I called to the attendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent on some mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which had passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden boxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the face, as if with violent exercise. Before I could get up to him the patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to knock his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just at the moment I believe he would have killed the man there and then. The other fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of his heavy whip. It was a terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but seized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and fro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others were both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we began to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat on him, he began to shout: &#8216;I&#8217;ll frustrate them! They shan&#8217;t rob me! they shan&#8217;t murder me by inches! I&#8217;ll fight for my Lord and Master!&#8217; and all sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded room. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set it all right; and he is going on well.</p>

Their threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman. They said that if it had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of him. They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their labours of any place of public entertainment. I quite understood their drift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and with each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of meeting so &#8216;bloomin&#8217; good a bloke&#8217; as your correspondent. I took their names and addresses, in case they might be needed.

Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly. Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him that it really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew either father or mother, so that the dear old man&#8217;s death is a real blow to me. Jonathan is greatly distressed. It is not only that he feels sorrow, deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life, and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the dream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account. He says the amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous. He begins to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up, and <span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">my</em></span> belief in <span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">him</em></span> helps him to have a belief in himself. But it is here that the grave shock that he experienced tells upon him the most. Oh, it is too hard that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his&#8212;a nature which enabled him by our dear, good friend&#8217;s aid to rise from clerk to master in a few years&#8212;should be so injured that the very essence of its strength is gone. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles in the midst of your own happiness; but, Lucy dear, I must tell some one, for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan tries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in. I dread coming up to London, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor Mr. Hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his father. As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief mourner. I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a few minutes. Forgive me for troubling you. With all blessings,</p>

I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And he has been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late&#8212;Lucy&#8217;s mother and Arthur&#8217;s father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.</p>

We wanted Arthur to go to rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when I told him that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed to go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. &#8220;Come, my child,&#8221; he said; &#8220;come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. You must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms. Come to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two sofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we sleep.&#8221; Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy&#8217;s face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She lay quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it should be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room, as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the window-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy&#8217;s neck, over the silk handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of the same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they had been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her, and presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly, and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight, and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled round&#8212;doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim&#8212;and every now and again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat, I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic flowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat watching her.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p0j6HVre6"><span class="hspanem"><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">Minion Pro Condensed Display 1</strong></span><span class="hspanem"><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">0</strong></span><span class="hspanem"><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">pt</strong></span><span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem"> </em></span>Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed. She took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be with her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto so marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she waked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.</p>

Arthur had then fallen into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy&#8217;s face I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a sharp whisper: &#8220;Draw up the blind; I want light!&#8221; Then he bent down, and, with his face almost touching Lucy&#8217;s, examined her carefully. He removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As he did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, &#8220;Mein Gott!&#8221; as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too, and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.</p>

He was dazed for a moment, but when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters he thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy was still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van Helsing and I feared that the end was near. He covered his face with his hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained, perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders shook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. &#8220;Come,&#8221; I said, &#8220;my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best and easiest for her.&#8221;</p>

He had even brushed Lucy&#8217;s hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered softly:&#8212;</p>

Then gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit her breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child&#8217;s.</p>

Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In a sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice, such as I had never heard from her lips:&#8212;</p>

I am so glad that he has plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the terrible things; and oh, I am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with the responsibility of his new position. I knew he would be true to himself, and now how proud I am to see my Jonathan rising to the height of his advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon him. He will be away all day till late, for he said he could not lunch at home. My household work is done, so I shall take his foreign journal, and lock myself up in my room and read it....</p>

Poor dear! How he must have suffered, whether it be true or only imagination. I wonder if there is any truth in it at all. Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those terrible things, or had he some cause for it all? I suppose I shall never know, for I dare not open the subject to him.... And yet that man we saw yesterday! He seemed quite certain of him.... Poor fellow! I suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some train of thought.... He believes it all himself. I remember how on our wedding-day he said: &#8220;Unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane.&#8221; There seems to be through it all some thread of continuity.... That fearful Count was coming to London.... If it should be, and he came to London, with his teeming millions.... There may be a solemn duty; and if it come we must not shrink from it.... I shall be prepared. I shall get my typewriter this very hour and begin transcribing. Then we shall be ready for other eyes if required. And if it be wanted; then, perhaps, if I am ready, poor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him and never let him be troubled or worried with it at all. If ever Jonathan quite gets over the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all, and I can ask him questions and find out things, and see how I may comfort him.</p>

That is the reason of his coming; it is concerning Lucy and her sleep-walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know the real truth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of my imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. Of course it is about Lucy. That habit came back to the poor dear, and that awful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost forgotten in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have told him of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all about it; and now he wants me to tell him what she knows, so that he may understand. I hope I did right in not saying anything of it to Mrs. Westenra; I should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it even a negative one, brought harm on poor dear Lucy. I hope, too, Dr. Van Helsing will not blame me; I have had so much trouble and anxiety of late that I feel I cannot bear more just at present.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pp7lgzZjn">I suppose a cry does us all good at times&#8212;clears the air as other rain does. Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me, and then Jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day and night, the first time we have been parted since our marriage. I do hope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing will occur to upset him. It is two o&#8217;clock, and the doctor will be here soon now. I shall say nothing of Jonathan&#8217;s journal unless he asks me. I am so glad I have type-written out my own journal, so that, in case he asks about Lucy, I can hand it to him; it will save much questioning.</p>

Oh, what a strange meeting, and how it all makes my head whirl round! I feel like one in a dream. Can it be all possible, or even a part of it? If I had not read Jonathan&#8217;s journal first, I should never have accepted even a possibility. Poor, poor, dear Jonathan! How he must have suffered. Please the good God, all this may not upset him again. I shall try to save him from it; but it may be even a consolation and a help to him&#8212;terrible though it be and awful in its consequences&#8212;to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did not deceive him, and that it is all true. It may be that it is the doubt which haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, no matter which&#8212;waking or dreaming&#8212;may prove the truth, he will be more satisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be a good man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur&#8217;s friend and Dr. Seward&#8217;s, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after Lucy. I feel from having seen him that he <span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">is</em></span> good and kind and of a noble nature. When he comes to-morrow I shall ask him about Jonathan; and then, please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good end. I used to think I would like to practise interviewing; Jonathan&#8217;s friend on &#8220;The Exeter News&#8221; told him that memory was everything in such work&#8212;that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word spoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards.

The poise of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; the head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. The face, clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute, mobile mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and the mouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart; such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it, but falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes are set widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man&#8217;s moods. He said to me:&#8212;</p>

Not a week since I said &#8220;Finis,&#8221; and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather going on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause to think of what is done. Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as he ever was. He was already well ahead with his fly business; and he had just started in the spider line also; so he had not been of any trouble to me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from it I gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey Morris is with him, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a bubbling well of good spirits. Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that Arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as to them all my mind is at rest. As for myself, I was settling down to my work with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I might fairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becoming cicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be the end God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows, too, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. He went to Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night. To-day he came back, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o&#8217;clock, and thrust last night&#8217;s &#8220;Westminster Gazette&#8221; into my hand.</p>

    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pK3i03tJ1">&#8220;Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?&#8221; He raised his head and looked at me, and somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. &#8220;Would I were!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. Oh, my friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell you so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you all my life? Was it because I wished to give you pain? Was it that I wanted, now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a fearful death? Ah no!&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pAOu8M62J">&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; said I. He went on:&#8212;</p>

But even yet I do not expect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always believed the &#8216;no&#8217; of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. To-night I go to prove it. Dare you come with me?&#8221;</p>

If it be not true, then proof will be relief; at worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yet very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come, I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that child in the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers say the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were in class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if he will not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that we wish to learn. And then&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;</p>

This is the key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give to Arthur.&#8221; My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful ordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was passing....</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pdfHOFALl"><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">Trajan Pro 3 1</strong><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">0</strong><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">pt</strong> We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and altogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its throat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the similarity to those which had been on Lucy&#8217;s throat. They were smaller, and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what he attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern heights of London. &#8220;Out of so many harmless ones,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there may be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from the Zo&#246;logical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred there from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days ago a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a week after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the Heath and in every alley in the place until this &#8216;bloofer lady&#8217; scare came along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Even this poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the nurse if he might go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted to play with the &#8216;bloofer lady.&#8217;&#160;&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pQyRKFmdQ"><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">Trajan Pro 3 </strong><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">9</strong><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">pt</strong> &#8220;I hope,&#8221; said Van Helsing, &#8220;that when you are sending the child home you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fancies to stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another night, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I suppose you will not let it away for some days?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pISZpSu72"><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">Trajan Pro 3 </strong><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">8</strong><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">pt</strong> &#8220;Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not healed.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pDOAObirp">Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and the sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw how dark it was, he said:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pV2w7oRQ2">&#8220;There is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seek somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pquaikIfu">We dined at &#8220;Jack Straw&#8217;s Castle&#8221; along with a little crowd of bicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o&#8217;clock we started from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual radius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse police going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of the churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty&#8212;for it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us&#8212;we found the Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door, and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to precede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring, one. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle, proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been imagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life&#8212;animal life&#8212;was not the only thing which could pass away.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="plA4tcc7Z">Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he made assurance of Lucy&#8217;s coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took out a turnscrew.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pPKEDB7yJ">&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; I asked.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pUsuBFnFQ">&#8220;To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced.&#8221; Straightway he began taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took hold of his hand to stop him. He only said: &#8220;You shall see,&#8221; and again fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. We doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to such things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never stopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to look.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pHUx9IqGZ">I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p9rb79Cyk">It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his ground, and so emboldened to proceed in his task. &#8220;Are you satisfied now, friend John?&#8221; he asked.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pzRsFVqMq">I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as I answered him:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="puMAbMQoV">&#8220;I am satisfied that Lucy&#8217;s body is not in that coffin; but that only proves one thing.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p3ZgMgzQw">&#8220;And what is that, friend John?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p1fIeIb64">&#8220;That it is not there.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p52B27WcA">&#8220;That is good logic,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so far as it goes. But how do you&#8212;how can you&#8212;account for it not being there?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pkkRqMZRF">&#8220;Perhaps a body-snatcher,&#8221; I suggested. &#8220;Some of the undertaker&#8217;s people may have stolen it.&#8221; I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. &#8220;Ah well!&#8221; he said, &#8220;we must have more proof. Come with me.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pK1kDgbV5">He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and locked it. He handed me the key, saying: &#8220;Will you keep it? You had better be assured.&#8221; I laughed&#8212;it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am bound to say&#8212;as I motioned him to keep it. &#8220;A key is nothing,&#8221; I said; &#8220;there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock of that kind.&#8221; He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at the other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my sight.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pqJqX1Oe0">It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled and unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand and with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had a dreary, miserable time.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pf3aDbTyQ">Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard farthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the Professor&#8217;s side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I too moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an early cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden by trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard the rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. When he saw me he held it out to me, and said:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pIAuObWme">&#8220;Are you satisfied now?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pZiQiEOie">&#8220;No,&#8221; I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pxJ1nr3HS">&#8220;Do you not see the child?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pT3RkHqg3">&#8220;Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?&#8221; I asked.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="psbu69yxk">&#8220;We shall see,&#8221; said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="ppJFWeJMY">When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child&#8217;s throat. It was without a scratch or scar of any kind.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pTvbhZwxc">&#8220;Was I right?&#8221; I asked triumphantly.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pNtvr56QZ">&#8220;We were just in time,&#8221; said the Professor thankfully.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p3dTaG7kp">We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted about it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child. So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out well. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman&#8217;s heavy tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation of astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got a cab near the &#8220;Spaniards,&#8221; and drove to town.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pLkIhZc2L">I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours&#8217; sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I shall go with him on another expedition.</p>
    <p data-hederis-type="hblkline-space" class="hblkline-space" id="p5qosXZgG" role="separator"/>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pXGxbzwh1"><span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">27 September.</em></span>&#8212;It was two o&#8217;clock before we found a suitable opportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed, and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw the sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe till morning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not want more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were incurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless. Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however, and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road, no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy&#8217;s coffin, and I followed. He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock of surprise and dismay shot through me.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pRFhT7bU7">There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her funeral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I could not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than before; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="piswUJ6xu">&#8220;Is this a juggle?&#8221; I said to him.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pJTVLxuGt">&#8220;Are you convinced now?&#8221; said the Professor in response, and as he spoke he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the dead lips and showed the white teeth.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pJrFiDN9s">&#8220;See,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;see, they are even sharper than before. With this and this&#8221;&#8212;and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below it&#8212;&#8220;the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend John?&#8221; Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I <span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">could</em></span> not accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkdateline" id="pa5PSpwtN">&#8220;She may have been placed here since last night.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pW7pTXUaH">&#8220;Indeed? That is so, and by whom?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pcEsT4sQ1">&#8220;I do not know. Some one has done it.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pEB5VrbO6">&#8220;And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would not look so.&#8221; I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing did not seem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor triumph. He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and examining the teeth. Then he turned to me and said:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="plvETQUoD">&#8220;Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is some dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampire when she was in a trance, sleep-walking&#8212;oh, you start; you do not know that, friend John, but you shall know it all later&#8212;and in trance could he best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance she is Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually when the Un-Dead sleep at home&#8221;&#8212;as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of his arm to designate what to a vampire was &#8220;home&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;their face show what they are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back to the nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and so it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep.&#8221; This turned my blood cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing&#8217;s theories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the idea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in my face, for he said almost joyously:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pUeB6klfR">&#8220;Ah, you believe now?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p4ZlWEiSA">I answered: &#8220;Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to accept. How will you do this bloody work?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pT8NOZmAl">&#8220;I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall drive a stake through her body.&#8221; It made me shudder to think of so mutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feeling was not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to shudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective, or all objective?</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pP5LymPCa">I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as if wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a snap, and said:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pI11TW7qU">&#8220;I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If I did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is simple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act now would be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have to want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw the wounds on Lucy&#8217;s throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child&#8217;s at the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full to-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more beautiful in a whole week, after she die&#8212;if you know of this and know of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard, and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He doubted me when I took him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he has forgiven me because in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say good-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea this woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have killed her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that have killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always. Yet he never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he will sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, he will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all, an Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now, since I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor fellow, must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to him; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. My mind is made up. Let us go. You return home for to-night to your asylum, and see that all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in this churchyard in my own way. To-morrow night you will come to me to the Berkeley Hotel at ten of the clock. I shall send for Arthur to come too, and also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood. Later we shall all have work to do. I come with you so far as Piccadilly and there dine, for I must be back here before the sun set.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pFV2uUOJU">So we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the churchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly.</p>

    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pf5vUgRSZ">&#8220;I write this in case anything should happen. I go alone to watch in that churchyard. It pleases me that the Un-Dead, Miss Lucy, shall not leave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager. Therefore I shall fix some things she like not&#8212;garlic and a crucifix&#8212;and so seal up the door of the tomb. She is young as Un-Dead, and will heed. Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out; they may not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the Un-Dead is desperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may be. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise, and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it. For Miss Lucy or from her, I have no fear; but that other to whom is there that she is Un-Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter. He is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that all along he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy&#8217;s life, and we lost; and in many ways the Un-Dead are strong. He have always the strength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who gave our strength to Miss Lucy it also is all to him. Besides, he can summon his wolf and I know not what. So if it be that he come thither on this night he shall find me; but none other shall&#8212;until it be too late. But it may be that he will not attempt the place. There is no reason why he should; his hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the Un-Dead woman sleep, and the one old man watch.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pNAeckaXj">&#8220;Therefore I write this in case....

Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing&#8217;s monstrous ideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on common sense. I have no doubt that he believes it all. I wonder if his mind can have become in any way unhinged. Surely there must be <span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">some</em></span> rational explanation of all these mysterious things. Is it possible that the Professor can have done it himself? He is so abnormally clever that if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to some fixed idea in a wonderful way. I am loath to think it, and indeed it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that Van Helsing was mad; but anyhow I shall watch him carefully. I may get some light on the mystery.</p>

    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p1OK2ZTxE"><span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">29 September, morning.</em></span>.... Last night, at a little before ten o&#8217;clock, Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing&#8217;s room; he told us all that he wanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all our wills were centred in his. He began by saying that he hoped we would all come with him too, &#8220;for,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there is a grave duty to be done there. You were doubtless surprised at my letter?&#8221; This query was directly addressed to Lord Godalming.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pZ8b5WpsW">&#8220;I was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so much trouble around my house of late that I could do without any more. I have been curious, too, as to what you mean. Quincey and I talked it over; but the more we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself that I&#8217;m about up a tree as to any meaning about anything.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pz77ejrrH">&#8220;Me too,&#8221; said Quincey Morris laconically.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pi7qdtuhK">&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the Professor, &#8220;then you are nearer the beginning, both of you, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he can even get so far as to begin.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pscR2KoXr">It was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of mind without my saying a word. Then, turning to the other two, he said with intense gravity:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p9DIkJG86">&#8220;I want your permission to do what I think good this night. It is, I know, much to ask; and when you know what it is I propose to do you will know, and only then, how much. Therefore may I ask that you promise me in the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for a time&#8212;I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may be&#8212;you shall not blame yourselves for anything.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p2qxgnFMu">&#8220;That&#8217;s frank anyhow,&#8221; broke in Quincey. &#8220;I&#8217;ll answer for the Professor. I don&#8217;t quite see his drift, but I swear he&#8217;s honest; and that&#8217;s good enough for me.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pJoVyKIgI">&#8220;I thank you, sir,&#8221; said Van Helsing proudly. &#8220;I have done myself the honour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear to me.&#8221; He held out a hand, which Quincey took.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pQtseRJsQ">Then Arthur spoke out:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pONfHBef9">&#8220;Dr. Van Helsing, I don&#8217;t quite like to &#8216;buy a pig in a poke,&#8217; as they say in Scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman or my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise. If you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of these two, then I give my consent at once; though for the life of me, I cannot understand what you are driving at.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pFc0L0EOe">&#8220;I accept your limitation,&#8221; said Van Helsing, &#8220;and all I ask of you is that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your reservations.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pOWAi3q8n">&#8220;Agreed!&#8221; said Arthur; &#8220;that is only fair. And now that the <span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">pourparlers</em></span> are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pRVgOKink">&#8220;I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at Kingstead.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pvKSirX8I">Arthur&#8217;s face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pdcjhsK9y">&#8220;Where poor Lucy is buried?&#8221; The Professor bowed. Arthur went on: &#8220;And when there?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="ps6fruFX7">&#8220;To enter the tomb!&#8221; Arthur stood up.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pmJimYPU7">&#8220;Professor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? Pardon me, I see that you are in earnest.&#8221; He sat down again, but I could see that he sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There was silence until he asked again:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pzVdhbrWD">&#8220;And when in the tomb?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pH4uGBERi">&#8220;To open the coffin.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="peCLmh6UF">&#8220;This is too much!&#8221; he said, angrily rising again. &#8220;I am willing to be patient in all things that are reasonable; but in this&#8212;this desecration of the grave&#8212;of one who&#8212;&#8212;&#8221; He fairly choked with indignation. The Professor looked pityingly at him.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p6utbLzjX">&#8220;If I could spare you one pang, my poor friend,&#8221; he said, &#8220;God knows I would. But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later, and for ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="poMxu4maY">Arthur looked up with set white face and said:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p71GXKIrT">&#8220;Take care, sir, take care!&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pTLiGqVS0">&#8220;Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?&#8221; said Van Helsing. &#8220;And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose. Shall I go on?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p9ZYuNnnL">&#8220;That&#8217;s fair enough,&#8221; broke in Morris.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pfkjuo1DW">After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pLNICFGHN">&#8220;Miss Lucy is dead; is it not so? Yes! Then there can be no wrong to her. But if she be not dead&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pVncMmztY">Arthur jumped to his feet.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pQ6syMNUY">&#8220;Good God!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;What do you mean? Has there been any mistake; has she been buried alive?&#8221; He groaned in anguish that not even hope could soften.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p4Sm4SoJx">&#8220;I did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it. I go no further than to say that she might be Un-Dead.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pVyMnlmBC">&#8220;Un-Dead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare, or what is it?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pEh6z5h38">&#8220;There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they may solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. But I have not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="ploskZ5qr">&#8220;Heavens and earth, no!&#8221; cried Arthur in a storm of passion. &#8220;Not for the wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body. Dr. Van Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that you should torture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to cast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad that speak such things, or am I mad to listen to them? Don&#8217;t dare to think more of such a desecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do. I have a duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall do it!&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pg8bMJVDr">Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and said, gravely and sternly:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="peJkeTvYP">&#8220;My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty to you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask you now is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if when later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its fulfilment even than I am, then&#8212;then I shall do my duty, whatever it may seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship&#8217;s wishes I shall hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where you will.&#8221; His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of pity:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pt9LjCVpd">&#8220;But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long life of acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can to save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so much of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land to do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and then to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her&#8212;I am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness&#8212;I gave what you gave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her lover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights and days&#8212;before death, after death; and if my death can do her good even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely.&#8221; He said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected by it. He took the old man&#8217;s hand and said in a broken voice:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pOl5RB6hU">&#8220;Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I shall go with you and wait.&#8221;</p>

    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pN4cB0GVv">IT was just a quarter before twelve o&#8217;clock when we got into the churchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across the sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly in front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took it that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant to his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door. He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p8yd8YDdK">&#8220;You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that coffin?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p9ALAGA4D">&#8220;It was.&#8221; The Professor turned to the rest saying:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="prLT2uI0V">&#8220;You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me.&#8221; He took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped forward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or, at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead, the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent. Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and recoiled.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pDcecV5fJ">The coffin was empty!</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pFTZ87INO">For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by Quincey Morris:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pHHdQHmnm">&#8220;Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn&#8217;t ask such a thing ordinarily&#8212;I wouldn&#8217;t so dishonour you as to imply a doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour. Is this your doing?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pLW6EIO6z">&#8220;I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor touched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and I came here&#8212;with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and saw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in day-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pbryh9W80">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pSCz3hrZa">&#8220;That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing, and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic, which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last night there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away my garlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But bear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be. So&#8221;&#8212;here he shut the dark slide of his lantern&#8212;&#8220;now to the outside.&#8221; He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the door behind him.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pc8LgH6r5">Oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of that vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and passing&#8212;like the gladness and sorrow of a man&#8217;s life; how sweet it was to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; how humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Each in his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, I could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the mystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing&#8217;s conclusions. Quincey Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of tobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a definite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white napkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the mass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thin strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its setting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close, asked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near also, as they too were curious. He answered:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pFzhWEFOf">&#8220;I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pLN1P3vd2">&#8220;And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?&#8221; asked Quincey. &#8220;Great Scott! Is this a game?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pbv5eFZ3X">&#8220;It is.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p25cMlf1M">&#8220;What is that which you are using?&#8221; This time the question was by Arthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pfCoICtvO">&#8220;The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence.&#8221; It was an answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor&#8217;s, a purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any one approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I, who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink within me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so mysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pTiuBeNmU">There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the Professor a keen &#8220;S-s-s-s!&#8221; He pointed; and far down the avenue of yews we saw a white figure advance&#8212;a dim white figure, which held something dark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave. We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a fair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. We were starting forward, but the Professor&#8217;s warning hand, seen by us as he stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the white figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice, and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the concentrated light that fell on Lucy&#8217;s face we could see that the lips were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pcOxnyB0l">We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even Van Helsing&#8217;s iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="ptybNKpF8">When Lucy&#8212;I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her shape&#8212;saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy&#8217;s eyes in form and colour; but Lucy&#8217;s eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of the pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have done it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God, how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung to the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell back and hid his face in his hands.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p0M4wg8fl">She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace, said:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p4jxUSAbF">&#8220;Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are hungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pcc6KCrD3">There was something diabolically sweet in her tones&#8212;something of the tingling of glass when struck&#8212;which rang through the brains even of us who heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed under a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. She was leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between them his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with a suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter the tomb.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="ppXo4bZCw">When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if arrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face was shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no quiver from Van Helsing&#8217;s iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of the flesh were the coils of Medusa&#8217;s snakes, and the lovely, blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of the Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death&#8212;if looks could kill&#8212;we saw it at that moment.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pZrlL8WHL">And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of entry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p8eUmbKPq">&#8220;Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pzAQfYv4y">Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he answered:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pHYFfNXWN">&#8220;Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like this ever any more;&#8221; and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice where scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty to the edges of the door.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p0OFm6dpA">When this was done, he lifted the child and said:</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pS4pJmRkQ">&#8220;Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is a funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. The friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock the gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this of to-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrow night he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will find him, as on the other night; and then to home.&#8221; Coming close to Arthur, he said:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pVXsC2y1A">&#8220;My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look back, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitter waters, my child. By this time to-morrow you will, please God, have passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn overmuch. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pLmWzjbAF">Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other on the way. We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all slept with more or less reality of sleep.</p>
    <p data-hederis-type="hblkline-space" class="hblkline-space" id="pJrDbwmB7" role="separator"/>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pc25Pdrk9"><span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">29 September, night.</em></span>&#8212;A little before twelve o&#8217;clock we three&#8212;Arthur, Quincey Morris, and myself&#8212;called for the Professor. It was odd to notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Of course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of us wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to ourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a long leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of fair weight.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pCqd9gKa9">When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the Professor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it behind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work by. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy&#8217;s coffin we all looked&#8212;Arthur trembling like an aspen&#8212;and saw that the body lay there in all its death-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy&#8217;s shape without her soul. I could see even Arthur&#8217;s face grow hard as he looked. Presently he said to Van Helsing:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pVnnojKaW">&#8220;Is this really Lucy&#8217;s body, or only a demon in her shape?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pjywV77eF">&#8220;It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her as she was, and is.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pTZFQe5Qs">She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth, the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth&#8212;which it made one shudder to see&#8212;the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a devilish mockery of Lucy&#8217;s sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and placing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue flame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about three feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To me, a doctor&#8217;s preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was to cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their courage, and remained silent and quiet.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pHrDk8qoY">When all was ready, Van Helsing said:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pbp7JQIcr">&#8220;Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers of the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change the curse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that die from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and prey on their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had met that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last night when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died, have become <span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">nosferatu</em></span>, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror. The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. Those children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if she live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her power over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that so wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays unknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when this now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor lady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free. To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the night when sleep is not: &#8216;It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it was the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?&#8217; Tell me if there be such a one amongst us?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pJKaON6Lc">We all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward and said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as snow:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pryi09vmF">&#8220;My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell me what I am to do, and I shall not falter!&#8221; Van Helsing laid a hand on his shoulder, and said:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pw8q760gQ">&#8220;Brave lad! A moment&#8217;s courage, and it is done. This stake must be driven through her. It will be a fearful ordeal&#8212;be not deceived in that&#8212;but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more than your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though you tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun. Only think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for you all the time.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pz90XcszO">&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said Arthur hoarsely. &#8220;Tell me what I am to do.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pPXiuvvvR">&#8220;Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the heart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer for the dead&#8212;I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall follow&#8212;strike in God&#8217;s name, that so all may be well with the dead that we love and that the Un-Dead pass away.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pc5ms5HBD">Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on action his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we could. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pV2J6Zhbe">The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur never faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. His face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little vault.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pdXJbkQD2">And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The terrible task was over.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pMe78coWL">The hammer fell from Arthur&#8217;s hand. He reeled and would have fallen had we not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead, and his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been an awful strain on him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than human considerations he could never have gone through with it. For a few minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the coffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one to the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had been seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad, strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of horror that lay upon it.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pSr1EZBbt">There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in her life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True that there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and pain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth to what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pn58LEhx0">Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur&#8217;s shoulder, and said to him:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pxbXXi4Q0">&#8220;And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="piPczZhCg">The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man&#8217;s hand in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pLzVFQ8qI">&#8220;Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again, and me peace.&#8221; He put his hands on the Professor&#8217;s shoulder, and laying his head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood unmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pwQuQ6cLc">&#8220;And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, as she would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinning devil now&#8212;not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she is the devil&#8217;s Un-Dead. She is God&#8217;s true dead, whose soul is with Him!&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p6XQPHVs6">Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the tomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point of it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with garlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid, and gathering up our belongings, came away. When the Professor locked the door he gave the key to Arthur.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pdGDhPLsv">Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There was gladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves on one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pXLZUUeKH">Before we moved away Van Helsing said:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="px0esk1pm">&#8220;Now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing to ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the author of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues which we can follow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger in it, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to believe, all of us&#8212;is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And do we not promise to go on to the bitter end?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="puUGiH9r2">Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said the Professor as we moved off:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pkhCxyl3H">&#8220;Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of the clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that you know not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plans unfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consult about, and you can help me. To-night I leave for Amsterdam, but shall return to-morrow night. And then begins our great quest. But first I shall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread. Then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is a terrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare we must not draw back.&#8221;</p>

    <p class="hblkh1" data-hederis-type="hblkh1" id="pb6pPY9fY">Dr. Seward&#8217;s Diary&#8212;<span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">continued</em></span></p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pxnLf8vFi">WHEN we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram waiting for him:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pHxfabTHB">&#8220;Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby. Important news.&#8212;<span class="smcap1">Mina Harker</span>.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pHdXEiCqY">The Professor was delighted. &#8220;Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina,&#8221; he said, &#8220;pearl among women! She arrive, but I cannot stay. She must go to your house, friend John. You must meet her at the station. Telegraph her <span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">en route</em></span>, so that she may be prepared.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p4siF16Is">When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me of a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewritten copy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker&#8217;s diary at Whitby. &#8220;Take these,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and study them well. When I have returned you will be master of all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all your faith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day. What is here told,&#8221; he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of papers as he spoke, &#8220;may be the beginning of the end to you and me and many another; or it may sound the knell of the Un-Dead who walk the earth. Read all, I pray you, with the open mind; and if you can add in any way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important. You have kept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? Yes! Then we shall go through all these together when we meet.&#8221; He then made ready for his departure, and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street. I took my way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes before the train came in.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pPJQCXUTV">The crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival platforms; and I was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss my guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and, after a quick glance, said: &#8220;Dr. Seward, is it not?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pqhtZ7OaQ">&#8220;And you are Mrs. Harker!&#8221; I answered at once; whereupon she held out her hand.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p3UZ523SQ">&#8220;I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but&#8212;&#8212;&#8221; She stopped suddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p4yfTx3Uh">The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it was a tacit answer to her own. I got her luggage, which included a typewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I had sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroom prepared at once for Mrs. Harker.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pUxXds0s8">In due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the place was a lunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a shudder when we entered.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p2kWa8wxm">She told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as she had much to say. So here I am finishing my entry in my phonograph diary whilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance of looking at the papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open before me. I must get her interested in something, so that I may have an opportunity of reading them. She does not know how precious time is, or what a task we have in hand. I must be careful not to frighten her. Here she is!</p>
    <p class="hblkh1" data-hederis-type="hblkh1" id="p43e0f4IN"><span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">Mina Harker&#8217;s Journal.</em></span></p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pYgS5S04v"><span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">29 September.</em></span>&#8212;After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward&#8217;s study. At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him talking with some one. As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at the door, and on his calling out, &#8220;Come in,&#8221; I entered.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p8sxyNdhT">To my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite alone, and on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from the description to be a phonograph. I had never seen one, and was much interested.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p4jwxEoSN">&#8220;I hope I did not keep you waiting,&#8221; I said; &#8220;but I stayed at the door as I heard you talking, and thought there was some one with you.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pAOuTMcjt">&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he replied with a smile, &#8220;I was only entering my diary.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p6qpdxD71">&#8220;Your diary?&#8221; I asked him in surprise.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pnKlvmq2r">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I keep it in this.&#8221; As he spoke he laid his hand on the phonograph. I felt quite excited over it, and blurted out:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pTp6a1nMU">&#8220;Why, this beats even shorthand! May I hear it say something?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p0bS4Gf5e">&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train for speaking. Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his face.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p6trWlOnc">&#8220;The fact is,&#8221; he began awkwardly, &#8220;I only keep my diary in it; and as it is entirely&#8212;almost entirely&#8212;about my cases, it may be awkward&#8212;that is, I mean&#8212;&#8212;&#8221; He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his embarrassment:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pp4KYFeRb">&#8220;You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she died; for all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful. She was very, very dear to me.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pGIo5yz91">To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pSoKIkUPv">&#8220;Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p2p7zweT3">&#8220;Why not?&#8221; I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me. Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse. At length he stammered out:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pjU0chs2Y">&#8220;You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the diary.&#8221; Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he said with unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the na&#239;vet&#233; of a child: &#8220;That&#8217;s quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!&#8221; I could not but smile, at which he grimaced. &#8220;I gave myself away that time!&#8221; he said. &#8220;But do you know that, although I have kept the diary for months past, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particular part of it in case I wanted to look it up?&#8221; By this time my mind was made up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being, and I said boldly:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pYcGEB1x8">&#8220;Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on my typewriter.&#8221; He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pcszoRlhh">&#8220;No! no! no! For all the world, I wouldn&#8217;t let you know that terrible story!&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="prdG7G6Qm">Then it was terrible; my intuition was right! For a moment I thought, and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or some opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting on the table. His eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his thinking, followed their direction. As they saw the parcel he realised my meaning.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pZaxiFMIn">&#8220;You do not know me,&#8221; I said. &#8220;When you have read those papers&#8212;my own diary and my husband&#8217;s also, which I have typed&#8212;you will know me better. I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in this cause; but, of course, you do not know me&#8212;yet; and I must not expect you to trust me so far.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pWQtBJH6x">He is certainly a man of noble nature; poor dear Lucy was right about him. He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged in order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and said:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pf31WynVh">&#8220;You are quite right. I did not trust you because I did not know you. But I know you now; and let me say that I should have known you long ago. I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you too. May I make the only atonement in my power? Take the cylinders and hear them&#8212;the first half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrify you; then you will know me better. Dinner will by then be ready. In the meantime I shall read over some of these documents, and shall be better able to understand certain things.&#8221; He carried the phonograph himself up to my sitting-room and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn something pleasant, I am sure; for it will tell me the other side of a true love episode of which I know one side already....</p>
    <p class="hblkh1" data-hederis-type="hblkh1" id="plr5Q35kO"><span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">Dr. Seward&#8217;s Diary.</em></span></p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pX8DePdUg"><span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">29 September.</em></span>&#8212;I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan Harker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without thinking. Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce dinner, so I said: &#8220;She is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour,&#8221; and I went on with my work. I had just finished Mrs. Harker&#8217;s diary, when she came in. She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes were flushed with crying. This somehow moved me much. Of late I have had cause for tears, God knows! but the relief of them was denied me; and now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, went straight to my heart. So I said as gently as I could:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pHQAnGCS8">&#8220;I greatly fear I have distressed you.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pC2IXN1ho">&#8220;Oh, no, not distressed me,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;but I have been more touched than I can say by your grief. That is a wonderful machine, but it is cruelly true. It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart. It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God. No one must hear them spoken ever again! See, I have tried to be useful. I have copied out the words on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart beat, as I did.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="ptdhQdEaV">&#8220;No one need ever know, shall ever know,&#8221; I said in a low voice. She laid her hand on mine and said very gravely:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p5nda7aOx">&#8220;Ah, but they must!&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="ps60ohh6l">&#8220;Must! But why?&#8221; I asked.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pit6pGFk7">&#8220;Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor dear Lucy&#8217;s death and all that led to it; because in the struggle which we have before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all the knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that the cylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know; but I can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark mystery. You will let me help, will you not? I know all up to a certain point; and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7 September, how poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wrought out. Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van Helsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and he will be here to-morrow to help us. We need have no secrets amongst us; working together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger than if some of us were in the dark.&#8221; She looked at me so appealingly, and at the same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing, that I gave in at once to her wishes. &#8220;You shall,&#8221; I said, &#8220;do as you like in the matter. God forgive me if I do wrong! There are terrible things yet to learn of; but if you have so far travelled on the road to poor Lucy&#8217;s death, you will not be content, I know, to remain in the dark. Nay, the end&#8212;the very end&#8212;may give you a gleam of peace. Come, there is dinner. We must keep one another strong for what is before us; we have a cruel and dreadful task. When you have eaten you shall learn the rest, and I shall answer any questions you ask&#8212;if there be anything which you do not understand, though it was apparent to us who were present.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkh1" data-hederis-type="hblkh1" id="pTLOpyaBZ"><span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">Mina Harker&#8217;s Journal.</em></span></p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pRYPkfh4i"><span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">29 September.</em></span>&#8212;After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study. He brought back the phonograph from my room, and I took my typewriter. He placed me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I could touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in case I should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with his back to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read. I put the forked metal to my ears and listened.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pqcHNcVnO">When the terrible story of Lucy&#8217;s death, and&#8212;and all that followed, was done, I lay back in my chair powerless. Fortunately I am not of a fainting disposition. When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a horrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case-bottle from a cupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restored me. My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucy was at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without making a scene. It is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if I had not known Jonathan&#8217;s experience in Transylvania I could not have believed. As it was, I didn&#8217;t know what to believe, and so got out of my difficulty by attending to something else. I took the cover off my typewriter, and said to Dr. Seward:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pqP6aYuxl">&#8220;Let me write this all out now. We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing when he comes. I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here when he arrives in London from Whitby. In this matter dates are everything, and I think that if we get all our material ready, and have every item put in chronological order, we shall have done much. You tell me that Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too. Let us be able to tell him when they come.&#8221; He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder. I used manifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done with all the rest. It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went about his work of going his round of the patients; when he had finished he came back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely whilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is; the world seems full of good men&#8212;even if there <span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">are</em></span> monsters in it. Before I left him I remembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor&#8217;s perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at Exeter; so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the files of &#8220;The Westminster Gazette&#8221; and &#8220;The Pall Mall Gazette,&#8221; and took them to my room. I remember how much &#8220;The Dailygraph&#8221; and &#8220;The Whitby Gazette,&#8221; of which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand the terrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I shall look through the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some new light. I am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep me quiet.</p>

    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="psJ9U6FuW"><span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">30 September.</em></span>&#8212;Mr. Harker arrived at nine o&#8217;clock. He had got his wife&#8217;s wire just before starting. He is uncommonly clever, if one can judge from his face, and full of energy. If this journal be true&#8212;and judging by one&#8217;s own wonderful experiences, it must be&#8212;he is also a man of great nerve. That going down to the vault a second time was a remarkable piece of daring. After reading his account of it I was prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet, business-like gentleman who came here to-day.</p>
    <p data-hederis-type="hblkline-space" class="hblkline-space" id="pajwrr5ef" role="separator"/>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p0690XIE1"><span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">Later.</em></span>&#8212;After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room, and as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter. They are hard at it. Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together in chronological order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker has got the letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the carriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his wife&#8217;s typescript of my diary. I wonder what they make out of it. Here it is....</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p7XAOFy1E">Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be the Count&#8217;s hiding-place! Goodness knows that we had enough clues from the conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript. Oh, if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy! Stop; that way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is again collating his material. He says that by dinner-time they will be able to show a whole connected narrative. He thinks that in the meantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of index to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet, but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall. What a good thing that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type! We never could have found the dates otherwise....</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pWxFS6zJs">I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands folded, smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed as sane as any one I ever saw. I sat down and talked with him on a lot of subjects, all of which he treated naturally. He then, of his own accord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to my knowledge during his sojourn here. In fact, he spoke quite confidently of getting his discharge at once. I believe that, had I not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of his outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for him after a brief time of observation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious. All those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can it be that his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire&#8217;s ultimate triumph? Stay; he is himself zo&#246;phagous, and in his wild ravings outside the chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of &#8220;master.&#8221; This all seems confirmation of our idea. However, after a while I came away; my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it safe to probe him too deep with questions. He might begin to think, and then&#8212;! So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of his; so I have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to have a strait-waistcoat ready in case of need.</p>
    <p class="hblkh1" data-hederis-type="hblkh1" id="pmurvHEbv"><span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">Jonathan Harker&#8217;s Journal.</em></span></p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p186Ucjj7"><span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">29 September, in train to London.</em></span>&#8212;When I received Mr. Billington&#8217;s courteous message that he would give me any information in his power I thought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such inquiries as I wanted. It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo of the Count&#8217;s to its place in London. Later, we may be able to deal with it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and brought me to his father&#8217;s house, where they had decided that I must stay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality: give a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes. They all knew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington had ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes. It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had seen on the Count&#8217;s table before I knew of his diabolical plans. Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and with precision. He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried out. To use an Americanism, he had &#8220;taken no chances,&#8221; and the absolute accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the logical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it: &#8220;Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes.&#8221; Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of these I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington could give me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs officers and the harbour-master. They had all something to say of the strange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local tradition; but no one could add to the simple description &#8220;Fifty cases of common earth.&#8221; I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me in communication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that the boxes were &#8220;main and mortal heavy,&#8221; and that shifting them was dry work. One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn&#8217;t any gentleman &#8220;such-like as yourself, squire,&#8221; to show some sort of appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a rider that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had elapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care before leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of reproach.</p>
    <p data-hederis-type="hblkline-space" class="hblkline-space" id="pK7eZ6OV5" role="separator"/>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pVXcy4iuZ"><span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">30 September.</em></span>&#8212;The station-master was good enough to give me a line to his old companion the station-master at King&#8217;s Cross, so that when I arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of the boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the proper officials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the original invoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here limited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I was compelled to deal with the result in an <span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">ex post facto</em></span> manner.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="puxBZaQNS">From thence I went on to Carter Paterson&#8217;s central office, where I met with the utmost courtesy. They looked up the transaction in their day-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their King&#8217;s Cross office for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teaming were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeing exactly; the carriers&#8217; men were able to supplement the paucity of the written words with a few details. These were, I shortly found, connected almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequent thirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opportunity, through the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a later period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pIWAWCKVX">&#8220;That &#8217;ere &#8217;ouse, guv&#8217;nor, is the rummiest I ever was in. Blyme! but it ain&#8217;t been touched sence a hundred years. There was dust that thick in the place that you might have slep&#8217; on it without &#8217;urtin&#8217; of yer bones; an&#8217; the place was that neglected that yer might &#8217;ave smelled ole Jerusalem in it. But the ole chapel&#8212;that took the cike, that did! Me and my mate, we thort we wouldn&#8217;t never git out quick enough. Lor&#8217;, I wouldn&#8217;t take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="ptupuYdJ4">Having been in the house, I could well believe him; but if he knew what I know, he would, I think, have raised his terms.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pX9mnTdxy">Of one thing I am now satisfied: that <span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">all</em></span> the boxes which arrived at Whitby from Varna in the <span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">Demeter</em></span> were safely deposited in the old chapel at Carfax. There should be fifty of them there, unless any have since been removed&#8212;as from Dr. Seward&#8217;s diary I fear.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pFoNBpfao">I shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from Carfax when Renfield attacked them. By following up this clue we may learn a good deal.</p>

    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pEXFlUBXw"><span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">Later.</em></span>&#8212;Mina and I have worked all day, and we have put all the papers into order.</p>

    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pNHRTUtD3"><span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">30 September.</em></span>&#8212;I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself. It is, I suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which I have had: that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act detrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a face as I could, but I was sick with apprehension. The effort has, however, done him good. He was never so resolute, never so strong, never so full of volcanic energy, as at present. It is just as that dear, good Professor Van Helsing said: he is true grit, and he improves under strain that would kill a weaker nature. He came back full of life and hope and determination; we have got everything in order for to-night. I feel myself quite wild with excitement. I suppose one ought to pity any thing so hunted as is the Count. That is just it: this Thing is not human&#8212;not even beast. To read Dr. Seward&#8217;s account of poor Lucy&#8217;s death, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity in one&#8217;s heart.</p>
    <p data-hederis-type="hblkline-space" class="hblkline-space" id="p2deKvRqa" role="separator"/>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="peY6jlRje"><span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">Later.</em></span>&#8212;Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we expected. Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan with him, so I had to see them. It was to me a painful meeting, for it brought back all poor dear Lucy&#8217;s hopes of only a few months ago. Of course they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van Helsing, too, has been quite &#8220;blowing my trumpet,&#8221; as Mr. Morris expressed it. Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all about the proposals they made to Lucy. They did not quite know what to say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they had to keep on neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter over, and came to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post them in affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward&#8217;s diary that they had been at Lucy&#8217;s death&#8212;her real death&#8212;and that I need not fear to betray any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as I could, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband and I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order. I gave them each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got his and turned it over&#8212;it does make a pretty good pile&#8212;he said:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="paLXJ5Fg1">&#8220;Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="phPoNkuzy">I nodded, and he went on:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pUbSDxz3X">&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I have had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble to the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy&#8212;&#8221; Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hear the tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid a hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the room. I suppose there is something in woman&#8217;s nature that makes a man free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for when Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and gave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. I hope he didn&#8217;t think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it afterwards he never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I <span class="hspanem"><em data-hederis-type="hspanem">know</em></span> he never will&#8212;he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I could see that his heart was breaking:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="phtQlqXVo">&#8220;I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to her. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you have had, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can help in your affliction, won&#8217;t you let me be of some little service&#8212;for Lucy&#8217;s sake?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p9CM2r9Pw">In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemed to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a vent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat his palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then sat down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an infinite pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid his head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook with emotion.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pjsd0NfQI">We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above smaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this big sorrowing man&#8217;s head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby that some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he were my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pHitcJ8a6">After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an apology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that for days and nights past&#8212;weary days and sleepless nights&#8212;he had been unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of sorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was surrounded, he could speak freely. &#8220;I know now how I suffered,&#8221; he said, as he dried his eyes, &#8220;but I do not know even yet&#8212;and none other can ever know&#8212;how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shall know better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me be like a brother, will you not, for all our lives&#8212;for dear Lucy&#8217;s sake?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pwY4endra">&#8220;For dear Lucy&#8217;s sake,&#8221; I said as we clasped hands. &#8220;Ay, and for your own sake,&#8221; he added, &#8220;for if a man&#8217;s esteem and gratitude are ever worth the winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should bring to you a time when you need a man&#8217;s help, believe me, you will not call in vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you will let me know.&#8221; He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that I felt it would comfort him, so I said:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pZ32ipzeX">&#8220;I promise.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pK8Odudkm">As I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window. He turned as he heard my footsteps. &#8220;How is Art?&#8221; he said. Then noticing my red eyes, he went on: &#8220;Ah, I see you have been comforting him. Poor old fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is in trouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p4lkYWqkY">He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw the manuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realise how much I knew; so I said to him:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pGWxBAkSB">&#8220;I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let me be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You will know, later on, why I speak.&#8221; He saw that I was in earnest, and stooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemed but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I bent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a momentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly:&#8212;</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pWC4lrCr7">&#8220;Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long as ever you live!&#8221; Then he went into the study to his friend.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p2CB6efuy">&#8220;Little girl!&#8221;&#8212;the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but he proved himself a friend!</p>
